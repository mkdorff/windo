# Windo

This was a project/iOS App concept where we tried to simplify the nightmare
of coordinating schedules - in a way that looked real good. We entered it into 
the design portion of a BYU App contest back in 2016 and got 2nd place! How exciting.

In tandem with the design, we (some nerds, @joeynelson42, @jdeanwaite, and @mkdorff) 
were trying to make the app a reality. It wasn't required for the competition so that probably burnt a lot of our motivation there. Nevertheless, we started and tried. I have
no idea how far we got, but probably not very far ðŸ˜£. The important stuff is the design. The following 4 screens are the majors views of the app.

The iOS app is originally from [here](https://github.com/joeynelson42/windo). The server
is originally from [here](https://github.com/jdeanwaite/windo-server). I just cloned them both into this repo. Again, I have don't remember how much was done.

I also redid the server once for a school project. It was... complete enough? I remember
it worked completely for everything I tried but also being terrified that it could probably
break pretty easily. Anyways, I've included my final write up I did for school, as well as the pptx I used to present it.
